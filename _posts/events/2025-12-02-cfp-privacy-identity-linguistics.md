We would like to invite contributions to an anthology about privacy, identity and linguistics. Contributions should be about how linguists are (and have been) anonymising or pseudonymising their data, how participants (and people mentioned) are affected by different means to protect personal and sensitive information, and finally, how linguistic research is affected now, and in the future, by the use of different deidentification techniques.  

We invite contributions in English which discuss these issues and others related to the topic of privacy, identity and linguistics. We are particularly interested in discussions which concern languages, including dialects and minority languages, in northern Europe, but also invite chapters on other languages and on general linguistics. We suggest that contributions could concern the following or similar issues:   

* Which information you are currently replacing, but also how and why this is done,  
* How personal information in data and metadata has been treated in your area of linguistics historically, 
* How replacements of personal and/or sensitive information affect the usability of data in your area of linguistics and the validity of any conclusions,  
* How replacements of personal and/or sensitive information might affect results in your area of linguistics, e.g. effects on semantics, pragmatics.  
* How replacements of personal and/or sensitive information might affect the participants in research in your area of linguistics, including pro’s and con’s of letting participants choose whether and how their personal information should be obscured in the data.  
* How researchers can navigate between their different responsibilities: protecting individuals from harm, while also acknowledging their contributions to the research, and doing reliable linguistic research that can be important to society.

For a chance to contribute to the volume please submit a title by the **30th January 2026**, and a 500-word abstract (excluding references) plus an outline of your proposed chapter by the **30th March 2026**. First chapter drafts **30th September 2026**. Abstracts will be peer-reviewed. We are currently primarily considering one of De Gruyter Brill's series as a publication venue.
